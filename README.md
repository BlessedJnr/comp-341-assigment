# Productivity Mobile App

This is a productivity app developed for Android Studio that aims to help users allocate and manage their time effectively in their projects. The app allows users to create any number of projects that they may want to track. Within every project will be sub-tasks marked as pending (for any task that has not yet been started), in-progress, and complete. 

## Features

- Add sub-tasks to each project
- Track the progress of each task by assigning its status (pending, in-progress, and complete)
- Get notified of tasks that are scheduled to start soon (within 24 hours) and those that are overdue based on their assigned dates
- Widget that displays the currently running projects on the home screen
- Ability to expand an individual project to view the underlying task details and to change the status of a task without opening the application
- Ability to make changes directly from within the app by navigating directly to a specific project
